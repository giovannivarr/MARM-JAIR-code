# Synthesising Reward Machines for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning 
## MCMAS
This folder contains the code necessary to use MCMAS to generate the witnesses from which the reward machines we have used in our experiments have been obtained. 

The `.ispl` files are the ones that can be given in input to MCMAS to obtain witnesses. The `.txt` files can be used to generate `.ispl` files by running the `ispl_generator.py` Python script. The script takes in input two paths: the path to the ispl generator (i.e., the `.txt` file), and the destination path where the output `.ispl` file will be saved.
