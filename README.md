# Synthesising Reward Machines for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
This repository contains the supplementary material and code of the paper "Synthesising Reward Machines for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning". In this README file, we describe the structure of the repository. The repository contains the following folders:

```
.
├── literature_comparison
│   ├── neary_et_al
│   └── toro_icarte_et_al
├── mcmas
└── waterworld
```

Each folder will contain a README explaining how to use the code in it. 

The folder `literature_comparison` contains the code and experimental results for the comparisons that we present in the paper agains the literature works by Neary et al. and Toro-Icarte et al. 

The folder `mcmas` contains the `ispl` files used to generate the reward machines, and the respective files used to generate the `ispl` files themselves. 

The folder `waterworld` contains the code and experimental results for the experiments performed in the continuous domain "WaterWorld", from the PettingZoo suite.
